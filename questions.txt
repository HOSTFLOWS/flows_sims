Are we only going to use max_model? Why?

Why does the fits sometimes fail? E.g.: 
RuntimeError: Error: Covariance Matrix is singular. Either two or more parameters are degenerate or the model has become insensitive to one or more parameters.
RuntimeError: All weights for filter H are zero. The fitter is in a part of parameter space where the model is not valid or there is no useful data.

Does it affect the fits using colour-stretch or dm15?
